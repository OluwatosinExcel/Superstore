This is a superstore data for different states in US. 
Here is a link to the dataset <[BA%3D%3D](https://data.world/ehughes/superstore-sales-2023)>
I downloaded  this dataset, cleaned and analyzed it using SQL.
Some of the data cleaning process involves: Checking for null values and replacing it, Leading and trailing spaces, duplicate data, etc.
I analyzed the data: Percentage sales per month, total sales per segment for each year, etc
Data visualization was done using Tableau.
